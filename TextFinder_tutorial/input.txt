Mark today down as host for one of the most anticipated Sweet 16 matchups in recent WGC-Match Play history. 
It’s Tiger Woods vs. Rory McIlroy at Austin Country Club.

With 18 majors between the two (thanks, Tiger), it’s easily the most high-profile match on the docket Saturday morning. 
When asked about it Friday, Woods simply said, “I’ll be ready.” McIlroy was a bit more coy, referring to how he was trounced by Woods during the final round of the Tour Championship in September.
