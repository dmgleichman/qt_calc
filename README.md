## Qt5 Book Code

Found lots of great examples at:
[Qt5-book-code](https://github.com/mutse/qt5-book-code)

This code is from the book:
C++ GUI Programming with Qt4 by Jasmin Blanchette and Mark Summerfield

The source code has been modified from Qt4 to Qt5 with only a few small changes.

First added is weatherballoon and weatherstation which use UDP to communicate.

## Converter

Finally made my own program: a fahrenheit to celcius converter!

## JumbleTron

A big jumble of everything for test. It's Ragu! It's in there!

This example is from chapter 3 of the Blanchette and Summerfield book.
